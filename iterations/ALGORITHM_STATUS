set limit of fermi cells to 1400 (don't worry about bitshift -100)

do not bitshit fermi cells (currently not bitshifting anything)

demand cells which had empty bases be at 1400 V
by setting gain corrs to unity for cells we put in today


later:
change large_edge to large_fermi and add the other large_fermi cells
change large_regular to large_psu
don't worry about resistive bases for now... maybe put it in the map

alpha distributions for large_psu(+resistive), large_fermi, small_russian, small_yale


large_fermi cells:
------------------
all edge cells
