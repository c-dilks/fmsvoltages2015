voltage limits:
 - set limit of large fermi cells to 1500
 - set limit of large psu cells to 1700 (1600 if bitshift>1)
 - lecroy voltage limiter set to 1700

supress dead cells by setting voltage to 0
 - 3 unstacked large cells
 - 7 small cells with broken PMTs

do not bitshit fermi cells (note: currently not bitshifting anything)

demand cells which had empty bases before 2/18 access be at 1400 V by setting gain corrs to unity for cells we put in that access

==============================================

later (for mapping scripts):
change large_edge to large_fermi and add the other large_fermi cells
change large_regular to large_psu
don't worry about resistive bases for now... maybe put it in the map
alpha distributions for large_psu(+resistive), large_fermi, small_russian, small_yale
